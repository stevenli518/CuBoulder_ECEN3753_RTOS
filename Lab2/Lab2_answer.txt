(Interrupt-driven method)
a.Measure the baseline power consumption in mW when no buttons are pressed 
and no finger is placed on the touch slider.
Ans:6.46mW
b. Control the LEDs with each pushbutton and record the power consumption in 
mW when each LED is lit.
Ans:7.95mW
c. Control the LEDs with the touch slider and record the power consumption in mW 
when each LED is lit.
Ans:7.95 mW
d. Light both LEDs using a combination of pushbuttons and the touch slider and 
record the power consumption in mW.
Ans:9.42mW

(Polling method)
a.Measure the baseline power consumption in mW when no buttons are pressed 
and no finger is placed on the touch slider.
Ans: 8.95mW
b. Control the LEDs with each pushbutton and record the power consumption in 
mW when each LED is lit.
Ans:10.43mW
c. Control the LEDs with the touch slider and record the power consumption in mW 
when each LED is lit.
Ans:10.45 mW
d. Light both LEDs using a combination of pushbuttons and the touch slider and 
record the power consumption in mW.
Ans:11.90mW

e. Use the compile-time switch to build, run, and compare the power consumption 
for the polling method in Part I versus the interrupt-driven method in Part II.
Ans: Thepolling method in Part I has higher consumption than the interrupt_driven method.
f. For the interrupt-driven method, reduce the frequency of the SysTick timer and 
compare the baseline power consumption.
Ans: The power consumption is about the same, because the CPU is still doing the same thing no matter what
the frequency is.

Testing:
My project works fine and pass for both Part I and Part II.
When both buttons are pressed, no LED is lit. And then release only Btn1 and I observe that only LED0 is lit.
Release both buttons and observe that no LED is lit.
Place my finger on the left side of the touch slider, LED0 is lit
Place my finger on the right side of the touch slider, LED1 is lit
Place my finger on both the left side and right side of the touch slider, no led is lit.
